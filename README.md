This library provides common constructs and functionality to ease CDK development.

The main objectives of this project is to

- Provide extended constructs that add additional functionality to existing CDK constructs
- Provide standard constructs that are simple to use and adhere to best practices
- Provide constructs for commonly used patterns
- Reduce the amount of boilerplate coding required to work with CDK

## Conventions

- **Standard** Constructs are simplified constructs meant for general use. They follow general best practices and have been given sane optimized defaults.
- **Extended** Constructs are extensions of Constructs in the standard CDK library which add functionality such as logging and monitoring.
- Other Constructs found in this library are crafted CDK constructs for specific common use cases which follow CDK's principle of composition over inheritance.

In general, you should use **Standard** over **Extended** constructs unless they do not fit your use case.
